# TANKS
## Description
A game about a platoon's last stand against countless enemies.<br/>
There is no winning this war. The goal is to delay the inevitable, one wave at a time.<br/>
Have fun!

## Requirements
- **Java 17** or newer installed on your computer.
- RTX 3090 or equivalent GPU.

## Controls
Pressing any movement key will move the tank in that direction at a constant speed.
To stop the tank, press the opposite direction movement key.<br/>
You also can not turn your tank around instantly (like in real life). You must stop first, then initiate the turn.
